I strongly believe that gaming industry is set to thrive like never before in 2024, and it's not just about the numbers â€“ it's about the diversity and innovation transforming the landscape. From casual games to competitive gaming, the industry is a playground for everyone. With a projected global gaming market value of $286.8 billion in 2025 and mobile games leading the charge. It's not just about gaming for fun; it's a serious business with an expected annual growth rate of 10.69% through 2028 .
